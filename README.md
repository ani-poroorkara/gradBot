# gradBot - Student Assistant!

gradBot is a [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com/) chatbot made with python and flask. This bot uses logistic regression to estimate admit chances to a graduate university. It takes inputs like TOEFL, GRE and CGPA to predict the chances of admit into your choice of university.
